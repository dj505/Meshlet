                        Meshlet is a LoRa mesh network node, designed to be compatible with the <em>Meshtastic®</em> project.
                        It's made to be deployed just about anywhere you want it to be - you can plug in a solar panel and set it up outside, turn it into a pocketable every-day-carry node, wire it up to your car as a mobile repeater, or even just leave it on a windowsill attached to a BBS script/Meshsense/etc.
                    </p>

                        <li>BME280 temperature/humidity/barometric pressure sensor</li>
                        <li>I2C expansion port</li>
                        <li>Dedicated 3.3V regulators for all major components, each with a self-resetting fuse</li>
                        <li>"External notification" header for a MOSFET-driven 3.3V buzzer, LED, vibration motor, etc</li>
                        <li>Raspberry Pi RM2 for optional WiFi (and Bluetooth, whenever the firmware supports it)</li>
                        <li>Total footprint size of ~42*32mm, half the size of a credit card!</li>

                        This board was partially designed with the intention of fitting those really cheap little hot plates you can get on AliExpress.
                        To save on costs, unless you're buying a prebuilt unit from me somehow, I would suggest ordering the PCBs along with a stencil and using one of these hot plates.
                        The cost of the hot plate is roughly equivalent to what you'd spend on PCBA "extended component" fees from JLC anyway, and you can keep reusing it! Just make sure you have a suitable USB C power source for it.

                    <p>
                        There are a few things I think you should keep in mind when using Meshlet:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>The BQ2185 only supports 1 cell in series!!!</strong> You can connect multiple in parallel if you know what you're doing, but please be safe and do your research!</li>
                        <li>There are some power test points for attaching extra expansion thingies if you can't power them through the I2C pads. I think the USB and 3V3 are obvious, but the "BMS" pin is the regulated output from the BQ25185 and will never exceed 4.5V. Good for hooking up to another regulator, if you need to.</li>
                        <li>The configurable charge rate very strongly depends on your use case. It is configured at 500mA by default, which should be enough for just about all use cases. <strong>You will need to lower this if you're using a battery smaller than 500mAh to avoid starting a fire!</strong></li>
                        <li>You have the option to attach a 10k NTC thermistor. This will cut off charging above/below certain temperatures. To use it, cut the "NTC" jumper on the front of the board, and solder it to the "THERMISTOR" through-hole connector.</li>
                        <li>The solar charging is based on the BQ25185's capabilities and is not a "true" MPPT. You will have the best results with 5-7V panels.</li>
                        <li>The RP2350, even when downclocked, still consumes more power than an nRF52. It's not as bad as the ESP32, though, and I've been able to achieve several days of runtime on a 3000mAh battery. You should consider using a larger solar panel and battery than you would for a super low power node, if it needs to sustain itself with sunlight.</li>
                        <li>WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities depend on whether you can get your hands on the Raspberry Pi Radio Module 2 (RMC20452T). Currently, the firmware only supports WiFi.</li>
                        <li>The on-board power switch originally present has been removed from version 2, as it's more than adequate to simply wire a switch in series with the board's power supply. Please make sure that you select a suitable switch for the task!</li>
                    </ul>
